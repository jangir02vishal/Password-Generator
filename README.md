# Password-Generator

This Java Console Application serves as a versatile tool for generating secure and randomized passwords while offering robust password strength checks. Developed during the Winter Break of the second year, inspired by the need for a stronger password for social media, this project showcases skills gained from the Object-Oriented Effective Java Programming course.

## Functionalities

### 1. Generating a Password:

- Users define preferences by answering "Yes" or "No" to questions about uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
- Desired password length is specified by the user.
- A password alphabet is dynamically generated based on user preferences.
- Random characters from the password alphabet are combined to create a completely random string.
- The generated password is displayed on the console.

### 2. Checking a Password's Strength:

The strength check considers:
- Use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Password length, with a minimum of 8 characters and a recommended minimum of 16 for enhanced security.

A calculated score determines the password strength, providing users with clear feedback (weak/medium/good/great).

### 3. Displaying Useful Information:

In addition to password generation and strength checks, the application provides valuable information on password security. Users receive guidance on avoiding common pitfalls, such as using the same password multiple times, character repetition, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, and predictable letter or number sequences.
